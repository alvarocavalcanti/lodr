Legend of the Dragon Ruby - An Online Text-RPG inspired by LORD

I needed to study Ruby on Rails and had to come up with an application idea to implement. Then I remembered the first program I coded during my first semester at college, a text-based RPG inspired by [The Legend of the Red Dragon (LORD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_Red_Dragon).

Thus, Legend of the Dragon Ruby.
