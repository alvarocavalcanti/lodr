# LODR - Game Design Document #

### Premise ###
This game is inpired by [LORD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_Red_Dragon), a text-based RPG. By inspired by it is meant to have some similarities, both on mechanics and on content, but as this is a study-project (for now) its scope will be strict, focusing more on the study needs more than the game's needs.

### Basic Plot/Game Dynamics ###
The player controls a hero that have a few attributes and can wander through a few locations (The Village is the central hub). On each locations she can perform some actions, that take in account the hero's attributes.

### Hero's Attributes ###

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Life Points | The higher, the better. If they go ZERO, the hero's dies |
| Constitution | Adds to both ATK and DEF, when dealing and taking damage respectively |
| Intelligence | Not sure when to use it yet. Maybe Magic Atacks. Who knows? |

### Locations ###

##### 1. The Village - Central hub. Here the hero can access all the other areas. The only options are to move.
