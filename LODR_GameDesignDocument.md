# LODR - Game Design Document #

### Premise ###
This game is inpired by [LORD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_Red_Dragon), a text-based RPG. By inspired by it is meant to have some similarities, both on mechanics and on content, but as this is a study-project (for now) its scope will be strict, focusing more on the study needs more than the game's needs.

### Basic Plot/Game Dynamics ###
